|----------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| FR001          | User Registration & House Join     | As a student, I want to register and select my house so I can start contributing to my house's points.   | The system should allow users to register by entering name, email, mobile number, and selecting one of the four Hogwarts houses. House choice should be locked.   |
| FR002          | Login / Authentication             | As a returning student, I want to log in so I can access my account and continue contributing.            | The system should allow returning users to log in using email/password or OTP and fetch their house and profile info.                                            |
| FR003          | House Chatroom                     | As a user, I want to chat with members of my house so we can coordinate cleaning efforts.                 | Each house should have a dedicated real-time chatroom visible only to its members. Messages should display sender name and timestamp.                            |
| FR004          | View Campus Map                    | As a user, I want to see a map of the campus with zones marked as clean or dirty so I know where to clean.| The system should show a map with color-coded markers (e.g., red = needs cleaning, green = cleaned).                                                             |
| FR005          | Request a Zone to be Cleaned       | As a user, I want to request a cleaning task if I see an area that needs attention.                      | Users can click a “Request Cleaning” button on the map and submit a title, description, and pinpoint a location. Red marker appears for that zone.               |
| FR006          | Upload Before/After Images         | As a user, I want to submit proof of cleaning a zone so that we earn points.                              | Users select a zone from the map and upload before/after images of the cleaned area. Data is stored and set to "pending review".                                 |
| FR007          | Task Verification (Admin/Manual)   | As an admin, I want to approve or reject submitted cleaning tasks so that points are awarded fairly.     | Admins can view submitted photos and mark tasks as "approved" or "rejected". Approved tasks change marker to green and trigger point updates.                    |
| FR008          | House Points Leaderboard           | As a user, I want to see which house is leading so I can contribute more to help my house win.           | The system should show a live leaderboard ranking all houses based on accumulated points.                                                                         |
| FR009          | Individual Leaderboard             | As a user, I want to see top individual contributors within my house so I get recognition.               | The system should display a leaderboard of users within a house, sorted by individual points.                                                                     |
| FR010          | Home Dashboard                     | As a user, I want a central place to see my house score and access other features quickly.                | After login, the user sees their name, house, current house score, and buttons for Map, Chat, Task Upload, and Leaderboards.                                     |
| FR011          | Magic-Themed UI/UX                 | As a user, I want the app to feel magical and Hogwarts-inspired so it’s fun and engaging.                | UI should include house colors, Hogwarts-style font (e.g., MedievalSharp), sparkles, and transitions that fit the theme.                                          |
| FR012          | View My Completed Tasks (Optional) | As a user, I want to see a history of my verified tasks so I can track my contributions.                  | A personal "My Tasks" page shows a list of zones the user has cleaned, with before/after images and date.                                                         |
| FR013          | Logout                             | As a user, I want to securely log out of my account.                                                     | The app should allow users to log out and clear session data, redirecting to the login page.                                                                     |
